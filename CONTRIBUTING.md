## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- Redis Server (for local development)
- Docker (optional, but recommended)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-trading-bot.git
   cd crypto-trading-bot
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Configure your environment**:
   ```bash
   cp config/.env.example config/.env
   # Edit config/.env with your development settings
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/update-readme
```

### Making Changes

1. **Write clear, descriptive commit messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new risk management strategy"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve websocket reconnection issue"
   git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
   ```

2. **Follow conventional commit format**:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `style:` for code style changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for adding or updating tests
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

3. **Keep commits atomic** - each commit should represent one logical change

## Code Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 and use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

### Code Quality Checks

Run these commands before submitting your changes:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Linting
flake8 src/ tests/

# Security scanning
bandit -r src/
```

### Type Hints

All new code should include proper type hints:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
from decimal import Decimal

def calculate_position_size(
    capital: Decimal,
    risk_percentage: float,
    stop_loss: Decimal
) -> Decimal:
    """Calculate position size based on risk management rules."""
    pass
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_trading_engine.py

# Run tests for a specific component
pytest tests/ -k "test_risk_manager"
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Follow the existing test structure**:
   - `tests/unit/` for unit tests
   - `tests/integration/` for integration tests
   - `tests/e2e/` for end-to-end tests

2. **Test naming conventions**:
   - `test_function_name` for unit tests
   - `test_class_name.py` for class-specific tests
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested

3. **Test coverage requirements**:
   - Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
   - All new features must include tests
   - Bug fixes should include regression tests

Example test structure:

```python
import pytest
from decimal import Decimal

class TestPositionManager:
    """Test cases for position management functionality."""

    def test_calculate_position_size(self):
        """Test position size calculation with various inputs."""
        # Arrange
        capital = Decimal("10000")
        risk_percentage = 0.02
        stop_loss = Decimal("0.05")

        # Act
        result = calculate_position_size(capital, risk_percentage, stop_loss)

        # Assert
        assert result == Decimal("400")  # 10000 * 0.02 / 0.05
```

## Documentation

### Docstring Standards

All public functions, classes, and methods should have docstrings:

```python
def complex_trading_strategy(
    symbol: str,
    capital: Decimal,
    risk_level: str = "medium"
) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """
    Execute a complex multi-indicator trading strategy.

    This strategy combines technical analysis, market sentiment,
    and risk management to determine optimal entry and exit points.

    Args:
        symbol: Trading pair symbol (e.g., 'BTC/USDT')
        capital: Available capital for the trade
        risk_level: Risk tolerance level ('low', 'medium', 'high')

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing trade details and execution plan

    Raises:
        ValueError: If symbol is not supported or capital is insufficient
        ConnectionError: If exchange API is unavailable

    Example:
        >>> strategy = complex_trading_strategy("ETH/USDT", Decimal("1000"))
        >>> print(strategy['action'])  # 'buy' or 'sell'
    """
    pass
```

### Updating Documentation

When adding new features:

1. Update inline documentation
2. Add examples to docstrings
3. Update README.md if needed
4. Update API documentation
5. Add usage examples

## Submitting Changes

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run the full test suite**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. **Check code quality**:
   ```bash
   black --check src/ tests/
   isort --check-only src/ tests/
   flake8 src/ tests/
   mypy src/
   ```

4. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

5. **Create a pull request** on GitHub
